# Synology_M2_volume
Easily create an M.2 volume on Synology NAS

This script will create a volume on your NVMe drive(s) for you. All you have to do is run the script and type yes and 1, 2, 3 or 4 to answer some simple questions.

It also has a dry run mode so you can see what it would have done had you run it for real.
